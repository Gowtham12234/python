Polymorphism means many forms 

->polymorphism is used in class methods ,wher we can have multiple classes with same name 

-> in (basic polymorphism.py_) there is code defiining a basic polymorphism that :
    * it contains 3 classes named as "car","boat","plane"

    *and they all have same method called 
    "move"
   
    * using polymorphism we had done this ove acceseble to every class using for loop..


-> in(inheritence polymorphism.py) there is code of implementing inheritence and we applied polymorphism over there

        *there we created parent class called "vehicle " and we created car,boat,plane as child classes 

        * and ther is common method called move 

        *in car class we had directly inherit the properties from vehicle and in child class we given pass keyword to access them 

        *in boat and plane they also inherited brand ,model but they overided means modified  the method called drive from vehicle class ....
