the two first fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1,and the next Fibonacci nubers is always the sum of two previous numbers
  example  :   0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...........

code will be (fibonacci folder) :

 approach1 (approach1.py) : create the 20 first fibonacci numbers 
   *implementing using for loop..
        ->start with two nums 0 and 1
            * add these numbers to create a new fibonacci number.
            * loop it for 18 times
            *Print the new Fibonacci number
            *Update the variables that hold the previous two fibonacci numbers


  appraoch2:
        printing the first 20 fibanocci numbers using recursive function
        *first we declare count as "0"

        *then we defined the fibanocci function  with two arguments called "num1","num2" to print numbers

        * redeclaring count as global because we declared count outside function and if we declared count as count without global the function create a local variable with same name thats why we mentioned global before count...

        *using if condition we run this process till 20 numbers

        add the two numbers and store it in a variable here it is "new"
        increment the num1 to num2 

        and increment num2 to newly generated number ,and increment the count to move forward

        call the fibanocci inside the function (recursive function == calling itself in the function ) to continue and print numbers ...

  approach3:

        -> using f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) formulae we can generte the nth fibanocii number.....
