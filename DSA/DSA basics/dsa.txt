DATA STRUCTRES:

        -> A data structre is a way to store data....
        -> according to the data we have ,we'll organize in different ways..
        ->helps us to manage large amounts of data efficiently 
        -> data structres are main component for creating fast andd powerfull algorithms.
        
    
    1.primitive data structres:
                ->data structres provided by programing language to represent single values like int,float,char,bool...
    
    
    2.abstract data structres:
                ->built by primitive data types and provide more specialized operstions,loke arrays,stacks queues,trees,graphs....

ALGORITHM:

        ->An algorithm is a step by step instructions to solve a given problem

Time complexity:  amount of time taken by an algorithm to run ,depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on ...

Space complexity:  amount of space taken by an algorithm to run ,depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on ...

brute force: a simpe and straight forward way that an algorithm can work by trying all possible solutions and then choosing the best ones..
