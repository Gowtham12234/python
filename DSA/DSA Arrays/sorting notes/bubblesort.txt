bubble sort is a sorting techinque (code in bubblesort.py)

        -> steps to implement the bubble sort ....
          
           * 1st we should declare an array without sorting 

           * then run outer loop using for loop it runs (n-1) times that the array gets sorted completely....

           *run an inside loop with (n-i-1) times
                    n= index,
                    i=how many times we have looped the array,
                (n-i-1) => for example arr=[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

                step1: i=0,so n-i-1  == 5-0-1 = 4(times)
                    * Compare 5 and 3 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]
                    * Compare 5 and 8 â†’ No swap
                    * Compare 8 and 4 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 5, 4, 8, 2]
                    * Compare 8 and 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]
                    âœ… The biggest number (8) is now at the last position (index 4)..
                
                 Step 2: i = 1, so n - i - 1 = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3
                        ðŸ”¹ We compare 3 times:

                        Compare 3 and 5 â†’ No swap
                        Compare 5 and 4 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 4, 5, 2, 8]
                        Compare 5 and 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]
                        âœ… The second biggest number (5) is now at the correct place (index 3).

                step 3: i = 2, so n - i - 1 = 5 - 2 - 1 = 2
                        ðŸ”¹ We compare 2 times:

                        Compare 3 and 4 â†’ No swap
                        Compare 4 and 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]
                        âœ… The third biggest number (4) is now at the correct place (index 2).

                Step 4: i = 3, so n - i - 1 = 5 - 3 - 1 = 1
                        ðŸ”¹ We compare only 1 time:

                        Compare 3 and 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
                        âœ… Now the whole list is sorted! ðŸŽ‰
