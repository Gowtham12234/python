 selection sort ==> 

           * go through the array to find the lowest value  and move to the front side of the array.

            * go through the array the untill it ggets sorted..

example :

        step1:  get started with an unsorted array..
                
                [7,12,9,11,3]  

        step2:   go through the array ,one value at a time . 3 is lowest . so move the 3 to front side of the array..

                [3,7,12,9,11]

        step3:  now move to the 7 and check if there any lowest value then 7 if exists get it in the place of 7. if not skip it ..

        step4: there is no least values then 7 so move to 12 , we found that 9,11 is less than the 12 so swap first 9 and 12 then 12 and 11..
                [3,7,9,12,11],

                [3,7,9,11,12]
        the array gets sorted..

implementation:

    to implement the selection sort we need :

            * declare an array.

            *run an outer loop that how many times that inner loop should run the loop should run through the max index of array(n-1) times..

            *now run the inner loop goes through the array.finds the lowest value and move it to front side of array..
