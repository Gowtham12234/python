1.linear search :

        it searches the given element snfd return the index if found else it returns -1

implementation::

        ** an array should be declared to search..
        ** and a target to be given to find the element in the array..
        **a llop that starts from start to end 
        ** if statement for finding if there any value that matches the target if it matches returns the index of the element if not returns -1...

2.Binary search:

        an algorithm that searches the elements in the sorted array and return the index of the Value.

        Check the value in the center of the array.

        If the target value is lower, search the left half of the array. If the target value is higher, search the right half.

        Continue step 1 and 2 for the new reduced part of the array until the target value is found or until the search area is empty.

        If the value is found, return the target value index. If the target value is not found, return -1.
