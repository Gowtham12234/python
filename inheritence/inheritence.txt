   -> inheritence allows a class to detive properties and mwthods from another class ,promoting code reusability..

   *parent class: is the main class that is defined and is also called as a base class
   
   *child class:is the sub class that uses the props of the base or parent class..

ADD __init__()FUNCTION:
    -> we have to add our __init__()function to skip "pass" keyword

    ->called automatically whe  a new object is created 

    ->when it is used in child class ,child class will not inherit the parent class

    -> to inherit the parent __init__function class we have to call the parents __init__()function.
