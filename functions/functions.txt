1.functions is a block of code to be executed when it is called 
a function can be defined by def keyword 

2.you can pass data as a parameter in aSRGUMENTS IN FUNCTION

3.a function can return data as a result

4.in python a function can be defined using "def"keywoard

5.POSITONAL ARGUMENTS:
    arguments based on their position (code in fuctions.py)


6.DEFAULT ARGUMENTS :
    *when no arguments are paassed in the function ,
    
    *it return the default value g9iven in code 
    defining function


7.Aribitary Arguments(args,*kwargs):
    args(Multiple Positional Arguments)
        ->*allows passing multiple positional arguments as a tuple..

    *kwargs(Multiple keyword arguments)
    -> *allows pasing multiple keyword arguments as a dictionary

8.SCOPE OF A VARIABLE:(code in scope&lifetime.py)

    * variables declared inside a function is called local variables and can be used in only that function
    * global variables are  declared outside a function and can be accesed in anywhere in code 

    we can declare global variable in local function -> it can be declared by using " global " keyword

9.RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS:(recursive.py):


    -> a function that call itself to solve a problem.it divides a problwm into sub problems of same type untill base condition gets true 

    ->BASE CASE: condition that stops recursion.
    RECURSIVE CASE:the functional part calls itself

10. LAMBDA FUNCTIONS:
    -> a laambda function is  a small ,anonymous function that can take any  number of arguments but has only one expression

    refer to (lambda.py)
